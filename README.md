# KNN-and-SVM-IRIS
Experiments with KNN and SVM on two well known classification data sets (IRIS
Description: Experiments with KNN and SVM on two well known classification data sets (IRIS - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. The data is available on the class site. You can also use Python libraries to read this data file.
This project is expecting you to write four different functions to test your solutions to the problem. You are expected to use the Python language. You will prepare a Jupyter Notebook including your code and results.


• Part 1: Build a classifier based on KNN (K=5 for testing) using Euclidean distance.
o You are expected to code the KNN classifier by yourself.
o Report performance using an appropriate k-fold cross validation using confusion matrices on both datasets.
o Report the run time performance of your above tests.


• Part 2: Build a classifier based on KNN (K=5 for testing) using Manhattan distance.
o You are expected to code the KNN classifier by yourself.
o Report performance using an appropriate k-fold cross validation using confusion matrices on both datasets.
o Report the run time performance of your above tests.


• Part 3: Build a classifier based on linear SVM.
o You may use an available implementation of SVM in Python.
o Report performance using an appropriate k-fold cross validation using ROC curves and confusion matrices.
o Report the run time performance of your above tests.


• Part 4: Build a classifier based on polynomial SVM.
o You may use an available implementation of SVM in Python.
o Report performance using an appropriate k-fold cross validation using ROC curves and confusion matrices.
o Report the run time performance of your above tests.
• Part 5 (optional): Improve your search procedure in Part 1 and Part 2 using an advanced search algorithm such as kd-trees.
